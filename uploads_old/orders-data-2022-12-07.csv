All on the same website page
And please consider all the things I told you.
P.s it needs the wireframes of the site as well at some points.
So:
• MUST follow the guidance from the word doc I've sent you 
• Website must be a static landing page nothing more, built only with html+css
• Website must have an embedded map with ""charging points"" for EV
• Website must-have ""cards"" with EV models for sale
• Website must have at the bottom a ""forum"" discussion, not long. Like 2-3 users interacting in a discussion about selling/buying an EV

this is a 2500 words paper to be delivered in 10 days,
It is a proposal for my term paper. I need the writer to write in critical analysis all the content. with internal citations and bibliography in Harvard references LSBU.
- you can modify the question and formulate it better, but my aim is to reflect the psychological effect of the consumer in the covid crisis and Brexit in the uk. in terms of communications, the market technicians must find other tools that are adapted to the new times, and marketing strategies and theories that are almost obsolete with this phenomenon.
.  how the consumption habits of luxury shoppers changed during the COVID-19 crisis and the exodus from London in the UK

- I attach two documents, one with a description of what the proposal should contain and the other with an example given to us by the lecturer of what he expects the work to be like. . 

-I want to emphasize that this is the proposal to the 7000 words project that I will ask you for in due course. Therefore I must ask that the proposal includes in a map a 10 weeks description of how I am going to do the work.

ASSESSED EXERCISE: EVIDENCE ANALYSIS (1,000 WORDS)


This assessment asks you to prepare an Evidence Analysis of four pieces of archival evidence gathered so far in relation to the shows set for the year. You should list each piece of evidence and provide a short discussion of how each piece is relevant to the module theme (Policies and Communities). 

Consider the key questions of the module in relation to four of the set performances for the module:

In what ways might theatre and performance be understood as techniques for producing or challenging â€˜communityâ€™?
How does performance generated â€˜from belowâ€™ interact with legislated policy â€˜from aboveâ€™?
You should choose four types of evidence from the list below (you may not include any other kind of evidence):

Photograph
Map
Diagram
A page from a book of critical, social or historical research
Theatre poster
Publicity image
Interview
Excerpt from novel/play/poem
Image of art work
Newspaper article
Theatre review
Government policy documents
NB: With the exception of images or materials retrieved from websites relating to theatre companies, newspapers or other public institutions, downloads from the internet do NOT count as evidence.  Please do not gather pieces of evidence from Wikipedia, SparkNotes, or other web resources of a similar nature.

The Evidence Analysis should be approximately 1,000 words long. Distribute this evenly across your four pieces of evidence, allocating 250 words per piece of evidence.

In what ways might theatre and performance be understood as techniques for producing or challenging â€˜communityâ€™?
How does performance generated â€˜from belowâ€™ interact with legislated policy â€˜from aboveâ€™?
You should choose four types of evidence from the list below (you may not include any other kind of evidence):

condensed into a proper Research Question
2. It contains a research concept which describes variables and
their links as well as hypotheses
3. It is based on a literature review that, given the scope of the
Mini Research Paper, will not be extensive but must contain at
least 6-8 sources

Learning outcomes of the assessment
The aim of this assignment is to allow students to demonstrate their understanding of two different approaches to counselling by comparing and contrasting them against a set number of key areas.
Learning Outcomes: In completing this assignment students will demonstrate:
1. Their understanding of two different counselling theories and how these compare and contrast with each other.
2. Their capacity to construct a clear argument and support this argument with evidence.
2. Rationale for assessment 5 | Pa g e
 The intention is that this assignment will test studentâ€™s understanding of two different counselling theories studied across Term 1.
The reason that an essay has been chosen is that it allows students to choose their own focus, within the parameters of the assessment brief, and to spend time thoughtfully engaging with the theoretical material, these skills (including the self- directed element) are congruent with a counselling ethos.
3. Guidelines for the assessment
SOCW1057 Introduction to Counselling Assignment 1: Theory Essay
Title: An essay comparing and contrasting two theoretical approaches to counselling, with respect to a) the premises concerning the view of the human being, b) understanding of mental health involved, c) the stated aims of the counselling approaches, and d) general idea of method or techniques of the specific therapeutic modalities chosen.
Word length: 1500 words Deadline: 07/12/22
Guidance:
You should select two of the following theoretical approaches. Remember that if you select approaches that you think other students wonâ€™t do, your essay will be more unique.
â€¢ Psychodynamic â€¢ Person-Centred â€¢ Gestalt
â€¢ Existential
â€¢ Behavioural
â€¢ Cognitive
â€¢ CBT
â€¢ Solution-focused
The essay should NOT have subtitles, but should have a structure that is divided into an introduction, then three main parts (shown below; 2,3,4), then a conclusion.
Suggested outline of structure:
1. Introduction: Provide an academically robust definition of counselling, state that there are many different ways that counselling can be approached that in turn relate to how human nature is understood. State the two approaches to counselling that you have selected to compare and contrast, and provide a rationale for why you have selected them.
2. The premises concerning the view of the human being: All approaches to counselling come with a conception of what a human being is, and thus how they can be helped to overcome distress or difficulty. For example, the psychodynamic approach views human beings as being mainly unconscious, which informs its approach to treatment. The cognitive approach sees human beings as rational

creatures capable of self-control. Your aim in this section is to show that you understand this guiding philosophy of what it means to be human for the two approaches you choose, and how these differ.
3. Understanding of mental health and the stated aims of the counselling approaches: In this section you should describe how the two counselling approaches understand the goal of counselling, and outline the similarities and differences of these. What is the conception of ideal functioning at the end of therapy? In psychodynamic theory it is assumed that some distress is normal, and thus present even in someone who is judged mentally healthy. In contrast, the cognitive approach conceives of an ideal rational thinker who sees the world clearly and can rise above emotional problems in this way. The stated aim of a counselling approach dictates how it is judged in terms of outcomes; in other words, whether a therapy is deemed successful or not depends on what it is actually trying to do.
4. General idea of method or techniques: In this section you should show your knowledge of what counsellors working within these two approaches do (or do not do) within sessions, and what kinds of techniques they use to facilitate therapeutic progress. This section will be enhanced if you can refer to specific studies that refer to best practice in the application of these techniques.
5. Conclusion: In your conclusion, summarise the key differences and similarities between your two approaches and present an argument for how these all stem from the premises about human nature that guide each approach.
